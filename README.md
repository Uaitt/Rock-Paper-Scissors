# Rock-Paper-Scissors
Today, after three weeks of working and studying js in the afternoon/evening, I'm finally ready to take on the first project from The Odin Project road map.
I'm going to build a Rock-Paper-Scissors game that will be played only entirely from the developer console (the GUI will be added later).

I'm pretty confident on this, coming from a C programming background I was able to grasp JS basics pretty easily and I remember almost everything about problem-solving.
this is going to be fun!
